# HELLO DIANA!
Welcome to Team DIANA's private repository. 
Team DIANA is a student team, based in [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/), involved in space robotics since 2008. The name is a Latin acronym, Ducti Ingenio Accipimus Naturam Astrorum, that means something like: Driven by intellect we understand the nature of stars. 

## Nothing to see here
All of Team DIANA repositories are private. We do this to protect the hard work we put in the development of our systems. If you are not a Team DIANA member, unfortunately you can't access our repositories! 

## So what are all of these repos I see?
All the public repositories you see are *deprecated* and archived projects that were forked almost 10 years ago. Since they are forks, we can't set them as private. They're a nice memory, but we don't use them anymore!

## I'm here for the recruitment
The repository for the recruitment will become published soon!

## I wanna get in touch
